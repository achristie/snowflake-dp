# Using Python
Snowflake has a <Mark>Python</Mark> connector so it is easy to use 
libraries like <Mark>Pandas</Mark> and <Mark>Seaborn</Mark> to do data analysis

## Installation

```bash
pip install "snowflake-connector-python[pandas]"
```

## Connecting

The first step is to connect to snowflake.
Many of the below parameters are easily found in the Snowflake UI, so start there if you are unsure.

```python
import snowflake.connector

con = snowflake.connector.connect(
  user = 'xyz',
  password = 'xyz',
  account = 'xyz', # reader account see below
  role = 'xyz',
  warehouse = 'xyz',
  database = 'xyz',
  schema= 'xyz'
)
```

for <Mark>Reader Accounts</Mark> you will be connecting to SPGCI's snowflake instance

- account: **spglobalcloudshare-ciprd**
- role:
- warehouse: internal_users
- database:
- schema:

## Executing a Query

```python /query/#v
cursor = con.cursor()
query = f"""
  SELECT * from forwardcurves_marketdata
  WHERE curve_code IN ('CN06J', 'CN06I')
  AND bate = 'c'
  AND derivative_maturity_frequency = 'Month'
  AND assessdate = '2021-02-09'
"""
cursor.execute(query)
df = cursor.fetch_pandas_all()
df.head()
```

| assessdate | curve_code |                       curve_name | derivative_position | contract_label |    value |
| ---------: | ---------: | -------------------------------: | ------------------: | -------------: | -------: |
| 2021-02-09 |      CN06I | LNG FOB USGC Cargo Financial Rel |                  17 |       JUL 2022 | 5.173000 |
| 2021-02-09 |      CN06I | LNG FOB USGC Cargo Financial Rel |                  28 |       JUN 2023 | 4.706000 |
| 2021-02-09 |      CN06I | LNG FOB USGC Cargo Financial Rel |                   3 |       MAY 2021 | 4.714000 |
| 2021-02-09 |      CN06I | LNG FOB USGC Cargo Financial Rel |                   9 |       NOV 2021 | 6.221000 |
| 2021-02-09 |      CN06I | LNG FOB USGC Cargo Financial Rel |                   4 |       JUN 2021 | 4.796000 |

This is the general pattern. You can change the <Mark>query</Mark> as you see fit.

## Data Analysis

The primary reason to pull the data into python is so you can do further analysis or visualization of the data.

Like a pivot table:

```python
df["contract_label"] = pd.to_datetime(df["contract_label"]).dt.to_period("M")
pt = df.pivot_table(
    index=["contract_label"], values="value", columns=["curve_code", "curve_name"]
)
pt
```
