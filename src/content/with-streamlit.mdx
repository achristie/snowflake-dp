# Using Streamlit

<Mark>Streamlit</Mark> is a fantastic <Mark>Python</Mark> framework for creating
dashboards.

In this example we will combine Snowflake, Streamlit and Plotly to create an interactive dashboard using the <Mark>NA Natural Gas Pipeline Flows</Mark> dataset.

## Installation

```bash
pip install "snowflake-connector-python[pandas]" streamlit plotly
```

## Imports

Create a file called <Mark>streamlit.py</Mark> and add the following:

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import snowflake.connector
from datetime import date
import plotly.express as px
```

## Connecting to Snowflake

Setup your connection to snowflake

```python /@st.cache_resource()/#v
@st.cache_resource()
def create_connection():
    return snowflake.connector.connect(
        user="xyz"
        account="xyz",
        role="xyz",
        warehouse="xyz",
        database="xyz",
        schema="nagaspipelineflowsmi",
    )

cursor = create_connection().cursor()
```

the <Mark>@st.cache_resource</Mark> decorator will cache your connection so you do not have to reconnect
every time you perform any action.

test the connection to ensure it works.

```bash
streamlit run streamlit.py
```

## Creating the sidebar

In this example we allow selecting a _FacilityType_, _Nomination Cycle_, _Pipeline_ and _Measurement Date_.

So, to start, let's get the distinct values for those fields from Snowflake to populate the dropdowns:

```python
q_facility = f"""
  select facilitytype from nagaspipelinereferencedata
  group by facilitytype
  order by facilitytype;
"""
cursor.execute(q_facility)
df_facilities = cursor.fetch_pandas_all()

q_pipeline = f"""
  select pipelinename from nagaspipelinereferencedata
  group by pipelinename
  order by pipelinename;
"""
cursor.execute(q_pipeline)
df_pipelines = cursor.fetch_pandas_all()
```

Nomination Cycle and Measurement Date do not need to be queried.

Now, let's create the _Sidebar_:

```python
def submit():
  st.write("Submitted!")

with st.sidebar:
    with st.form("selections"):
        facility = st.selectbox("Select Facility", df_facilities, key="facility")
        pipelines = st.multiselect(
            "Select pipeline", df_pipelines["PIPELINENAME"], key="pipelines"
        )
        nom_cycles = st.multiselect(
            "Nomination Cycle", ["I1", "I2", "I3", "E"], key="cycles"
        )
        dates = st.date_input(
            "Select Gas Date",
            (date(date.today().year, 1, 1), date.today()),
            format="YYYY-MM-DD",
            key="dates",
        )

        submitted = st.form_submit_button("Submit", on_click=submit)
```

Here we have created

- a selectbox for _Facility Type_ populated with `df_facilities` (result of `q_facility`).
- a multiselect for _Pipeline Name_ populated with `df_pipelines` (result of `q_pipeline`).
- a multiselect for _Nomination Cycle_ with hard-coded nomination cycles.
- a date picker for _Measurement Date_ defaulting to the range `Jan 1` to `Today`.

Go back to your app and you should see this:

<img src="streamlit-sidebar.png" />

## Testing the Sidebar

Let's make sure when we hit the `Submit` button we actually get the expected values.
These are the values we will want to pass to our Snowflake query.

```python
def join(lst):
    s = ", ".join(f"'{i}'" for i in lst)
    return f"({s})"

def submit():
    pipelines = join(st.session_state.pipelines)
    nom_cycles = join(st.session_state.cycles)
    dates = st.session_state.dates
    facility = st.session_state.facility
    st.write(pipelines, nom_cycles, dates, facility)
```

- We have added a the `join` helper function to make it easier to use the values in a SQL query.
- We have changed the `submit` function so it will display the selected values on the page.

Select a few values and hit `Submit` and you should now see:

<img src="streamlit-filters.png" />

## Visualize Data

Based on the selections, we now want to fetch the appropriate data and display it on the page.
For this example we will show a line chart of each pipeline's `Scheduled Volume` over time for the selected `Facility Type` and `Nomination Cycles`

Update our `submit` function to the following:

```python /query/#v
def submit():
    pipelines = join(st.session_state.pipelines)
    nom_cycles = join(st.session_state.cycles)
    dates = st.session_state.dates
    facility = st.session_state.facility
    st.write(pipelines, nom_cycles, dates, facility)

    query = f"""
        select pipelinename, measurementdate, sum(scheduledvolume) from nagaspipelineflows
        where facilitytype = '{facility}' and pipelinename IN {pipelines} and nominationcycle iN {nom_cycles}
        and measurementdate between '{dates[0]}' and '{dates[1]}'
        group by measurementdate, pipelinename
        order by measurementdate;
    """

    cursor.execute(query)
    df = cursor.fetch_pandas_all()

    fig = px.line(
        df, x="MEASUREMENTDATE", y="SUM(SCHEDULEDVOLUME)", color="PIPELINENAME"
    )
    st.plotly_chart(fig)
```

In this <Mark>query</Mark> we are filtering based on the values selected in the sidebar and getting
the sum of `ScheduledVolume` based on the `PipelineName` and `MeasurementDate`.
The query result will look something like this:

|     | PIPELINENAME | MEASUREMENTDATE | SUM(SCHEDULEDVOLUME) |
| --- | ------------ | --------------- | -------------------- |
| 0   | Transco      | 2023-01-01      | 2817236.0000         |
| 1   | Transco      | 2023-01-02      | 2839612.0000         |
| 2   | Transco      | 2023-01-03      | 2940717.0000         |
| 3   | Transco      | 2023-01-04      | 3033639.0000         |
| 4   | Transco      | 2023-01-05      | 3268283.0000         |

your app should now look like:

<img src="streamlit-done.png" />

If you change your critera and hit `Submit` you should see the chart update to reflect your new selections!

## Finishing up

<Mark>Streamlit</Mark> is a great way to quickly build a data powered app and with
Snowflake you can write adhoc queries to visualize the data any way that you see
fit.
