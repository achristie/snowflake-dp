## Simple Query

After you have access - sign in and execute this simple query against the <Mark>Market Data</Mark> database.

```sql
SELECT symbol,
       description,
       commodity,
       *
FROM   ref_data_marketdata
LIMIT  100;
```

| Symbol  | Description                                                                      | Commodity   |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |

## Pricing Data

The <Mark>Market Data</Mark> database also includes Pricing data for each symbol:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM   pricedata
WHERE  symbol IN ( 'PCAAS00', 'PCAAT00' )
       AND bate = 'c'
       AND assessdate >= '2015-01-01'
ORDER  BY assessdate ASC
LIMIT  100;
```

| Symbol  | MDC                | DESCRIPTION              | ASSESSDATE              | MODIFIEDDATETIME        | BATE | VALUE | ISCORRECTED | UOM | CURRENCY |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---- | ----- | ----------- | --- | -------- |
| PCAAT00 | CRD,CRO,CRU,RP     | Dubai Mo01 (NextGen MOC) | 2015-01-02 00:00:00.000 | 2015-01-02 07:01:36.000 | c    | 54.09 | N           | BBL | USD      |
| PCAAS00 | AFM,CRD,CRO,CRU,RI | Dated Brent              | 2015-01-02 00:00:00.000 | 2015-01-02 14:25:56.000 | c    | 54.98 | N           | BBL | USD      |
| PCAAS00 | AFM,CRD,CRO,CRU,RI | Dated Brent              | 2015-01-05 00:00:00.000 | 2015-01-05 18:07:38.000 | c    | 51.3  | N           | BBL | USD      |
| PCAAT00 | CRD,CRO,CRU,RP     | Dubai Mo01 (NextGen MOC) | 2015-01-05 00:00:00.000 | 2015-01-05 11:14:41.000 | c    | 51.4  | N           | BBL | USD      |

Snowflake provides a SQL interface on top of the data so you can do any adhoc analysis you'd like.
For example, below we are looking at the <Mark>Max</Mark> and <Mark>Min</Mark> monthly price for certain <Mark>Crude oil</Mark> symbols:

```sql
SELECT r.symbol,
       Max(r.description)              AS description,
       Date_trunc('MONTH', assessdate) AS month,
       Max(p.value)                    AS max_value,
       Min(p.value)                    AS min_value,
       Max(r.api_gravity)              AS api_gravity,
       Max(r.delivery_region_basis)    AS delivery_region_basis,
       Max(r.uom)                      AS UOM,
       Max(r.currency)                 AS currency
FROM   ref_data_marketdata r
       LEFT JOIN pricedata p
              ON p.symbol = r.symbol
WHERE  r.commodity = 'Crude oil'
       AND bate = 'c'
       AND r.assessment_frequency = 'Daily (weekday)'
       AND p.assessdate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-07-31'
GROUP  BY r.symbol,
          month
ORDER  BY month ASC,
          symbol ASC;
```

## Dictionary

Each database includes a dictionary view as shown below:

```sql
SELECT * FROM marketdata_referencedata
LIMIT 10;
```
